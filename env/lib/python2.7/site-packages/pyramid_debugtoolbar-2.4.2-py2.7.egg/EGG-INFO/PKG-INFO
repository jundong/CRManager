Description: ``pyramid_debugtoolbar``
        ========================
        
        ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` provides a debug toolbar useful while you're
        developing your Pyramid application.
        
        Note that ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` is a blatant rip-off of Michael van
        Tellingen's ``flask-debugtoolbar`` (which itself was derived from Rob
        Hudson's ``django-debugtoolbar``).  It also includes a lightly sanded down
        version of the Werkzeug debugger code by Armin Ronacher and team.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        The documentation of the current stable release of ``pyramid_debugtoolbar``
        is available at
        http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-debugtoolbar/en/latest/.
        
        Demonstration
        -------------
        
        For a demonstration:
        
        - Create a virtualenv::
        
          $ VENV=$(pwd)/venv # just set the path to our virtualenv
          $ virtualenv --python=python2.7 $VENV
        
        - Clone the Pyramid trunk::
        
          $ git clone https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid.git
        
        - Install the Pyramid trunk into the virtualenv::
        
          $ cd pyramid
          $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - Clone the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` trunk::
        
          $ git clone https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar.git
        
        - Install the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` trunk into the virtualenv::
        
          $ cd pyramid_debugtoolbar
          $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - Install the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar/demo`` package into the virtualenv::
        
          $ cd demo
          $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - Run the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` package's ``demo/demo.py`` file using the
          virtualenv's Python::
        
          $ $VENV/bin/python demo.py
        
        You will see a page full of test options to try when you visit
        ``http://localhost:8080``.
        
        
        2.4.2 (2015-10-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix a long-standing bug in which log messages were not rendered until
          the end of the response. By this time the arguments passed to the logger
          may no longer be valid (such as SQLAlchemy managed objects) and you would
          see a ``DetachedInstanceError``.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/188
        
        2.4.1 (2015-08-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove the extra query hash constructed when indexing into SQL queries via
          url as it was unused after releasing 2.4.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/232
        
        2.4 (2015-06-04)
        ----------------
        
        This release changes some details of the panel API, so if you are writing
        any custom panels for the toolbar please review the changes.
        
        - Document the cookie used to activate panels on a per-request basis. It is
          possible to specify the cookie per-request to turn on certain panels. This
          is used by default in the browser, but may also be used on a per-request
          basis by curl or other http APIs.
        
        - Add new ``debugtoolbar.active_panels`` setting which can specify certain
          panels to be always active.
        
        - Modify ``DebugPanel.name`` to be a valid python identifier, used for
          settings and lookup.
        
        - The toolbar no longer will clobber the ``request.id`` property. It now
          namespaces its usage as ``request.pdtb_id``, freeing up ``request.id``
          for applications.
        
        - Add a lock icon next to the request method in the sidebar if the request
          was accessed over https.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/213
        
        - Update to bootstrap 3.1.1.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/213
        
        - Fix display of POST variables where the same key is used multiple times.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/210
        
        - Fix auth callback so it protects the toolbar views. Auth system is tested
          now. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/226
        
        - Convert SQLAlchemy views to obtain the query and params internally; this
          allows executing queries with parameters that are not serializable.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/227
        
        - Adds Pyramid version tests and bumps required Pyramid version to 1.4.
          The pyramid_mako dependency requires 1.3, but debugtoolbar also uses
          ``invoke_subrequest`` which was added in 1.4. The ``invoke_subrequest`` call
          was added
          in pyramid_debugtoolbar 2.0; if you need Pyramid 1.3 compatibility, try
          an older version.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/183
          and https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/225
        
        2.3 (2015-01-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Support a ``debugtoolbar.includes`` setting which will allow addons to
          extend the toolbar's internal Pyramid application with custom logic.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/207
        
        - Fixed an issue when the toolbar is not mounted at the root of the domain.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/201
        
        - Fixed an issue where the `button_css` was not pulled from the settings.
          Added support for configurable `max_request_history` and
          `max_visible_requests`.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/206
        
        2.2.2 (2014-11-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Brownbagged 2.2.1, forgot to include the templates!
        
        2.2.1 (2014-11-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Several internal links were not relative causing them to fail when the
          app is mounted at a path prefix. See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/185 and
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/196
        
        - Pin pygments<2 on 3.2 as the new release has dropped support.
        
        2.2 (2014-08-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Avoid polluting user code with unnecessary toolbar css just to show the
          button. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/174
        
        - Inject the toolbar button into ``application/xhtml+xml`` requests.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/176
        
        - Make the toolbar accessible before another request has been served by the
          application. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/171
        
        
        2.1 (2014-05-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Add new "debugtoolbar." configuration settings that allow enabling or
          disabling various Pyramid knobs in a users .ini file. This for instance
          allows easy enabling/disabling of template reloading for the debugtoolbar.
        
        - Allow the toolbar to display always, even when the parent application
          is using a default permission.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/147
        
        - Stabilize and document the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.DebugPanel``
          API to allow developers to create their own panels.
        
        - Add new ``debugtoolbar.extra_panels`` and
          ``debugtoolbar.extra_global_panels`` configuration settings to make it
          simpler to support custom panels without overwriting the default panels.
        
        2.0.2 (2014-02-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix breaking bugs when run under Py3k.
        
        2.0.1 (2014-02-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixes a bug in 2.0 expecting pyramid_beaker to be around.
        
        2.0 (2014-02-12)
        ----------------
        
        - The toolbar has undergone a major refactoring to mitigate the effects of
          the toolbar's internal behavior on the application to which it is connected
          and make it possible to inspect arbitrary requests. It is now available at
          ``/_debug_toolbar`` and can be used to monitor any and all requests serviced
          by the Pyramid application that it is wrapping, including non-html responses.
        
          The toolbar will live-update (on conforming browsers via Server Sent Events)
          when requests come into the Pyramid application, and can be used to debug and
          inspect multiple requests simultaneously.
        
        1.0.9 (2013-10-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Use new ``pyramid_mako`` configuration directive add_mako_renderer.
        
        1.0.8 (2013-09-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on ``pyramid_mako`` (Mako support will be split out of Pyramid in
          1.5+).
        
        1.0.7 (2013-08-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Drop support for Python 2.5.
        
        - Fix computation of proxy addresses.  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/100 .
        
        - Make templates compatible with no-MarkupSafe Mako under Python 3.2.
        
        - Decode platform name to Unicode using utf-8 encoding to cope with nonascii
          characters in platform (e.g. Fedora's Schrodinger's Cat).  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/98
        
        - Raise a ``pyramid.exceptions.URLDecodeError`` instead of a raw
          UnicodeDecodeError when the request path cannot be decoded.  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1057.
        
        - Added new configuration option: `debugtoolbar.show_on_exc_only` (
          default=false).  If set to true (`debugtoolbar.show_on_exc_only = true`)
          the debugtoolbar will only be injected into the response in case a
          exception is raised. If the response is processed without exception the
          returned html code is not changed at all.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/54
        
        - Fix various UnicodeDecodeError exceptions.
        
        1.0.6 (2013-04-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Packaging release only, no code changes.  1.0.5 was a brownbag release due to
          missing directories in the tarball.
        
        1.0.5 (2013-04-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Parse IPs correctly when request.remote_addr is a comma separated list
          of proxies IPs.
        
        - If you are also using require.js, the debug toolbar's version of jQuery
          will no longer conflict with your application's version of the library.
        
        - Use the "n" filter to disable default_filters when including the raw
          SQL in links, leaving only the "u" filter (URL escaping).
        
        - Support for per-request authorization of toolbar middleware via
          ``config.set_debugtoolbar_request_authorization(callback)`` where callback
          accepts request object and returns boolean value whether toolbar is enabled
          or not.
        
        - Short term fix for preventing error when converting binary query params to json.
        
        - Fix sqlalchemy query duration from microseconds to milliseconds.
        
        1.0.4 (2013-01-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Add a ``debugtoolbar.excluded_prefixes`` setting.  When a URL path prefix
          matches one of these prefixes, the toolbar will not be shown on the resulting
          page.
        
        - Show the prompt and little text file icons show all the time, instead of
          only on hover.
        
        - Do not set max-height on result boxes (which result in nested scroll on
          the page, which makes it hard to find information quickly).
        
        - When an expression result is long, do not truncate with an ellipsis, which
          requires one more click to get at the information I need.
        
        - Support ``pip install`` from the github repository by adding all static files
          required to install in the ``package_data`` ``setup.py``. Setuptools usually
          uses Subversion or CVS to tell it what static files it needs to package up
          for egg distribution, but does not support reading git metadata.
        
        - The debug toolbar now use a patched version of require.js with a distinct
          private name that cannot clash with the dojo loader or other incompatible
          versions of require that may already be loaded on the page. You no longer
          need to add the toolbar to your own require.js to make it work.
        
        1.0.3 (2012-09-23)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``valid_host`` custom predicate used internally by pyramid_debugtoolbar
          views didn't use newer "ipaddr"-based logic.  Symptom: some views may have
          been incorrectly inaccessible if you used a network mask as a
          "debugtoolbar.hosts" option.
        
        - The debug console now works with Google App Engine.
        
        - The debug console now adds a shortcut for accessing the last result through
          ``_``.
        
        1.0.2 (2012-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved the toolbar and debugger javascript files to use requirejs for
          better dependency loading and module isolation to play better with mutiple
          library versions. Recurrent problem was with async loading and application
          specific jquery library where the expected version was overrided by the
          toolbar one.
        
          If you are already using requirejs and want the toolbar to load, just add it
          to your path and module::
        
            require.config({
              paths: {
                "jquery": "jquery-1.7.2.min",
                "toolbar": "/_debug_toolbar/static/js/toolbar"
              }
            });
        
            require(["jquery", "toolbar"], function($, toolbar) {
              $(function() {
                // your module
              });
            });
        
        1.0.1 (2012-03-27)
        ------------------
        
        - If ``request.remote_addr`` is ``None``, disable the toolbar.
        
        1.0 (2012-03-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Don't URL-quote SQL parameters on SQLAlchemy panel.
        
        - Allow hostmask values as ``debugtoolbar.hosts`` entries
          (e.g. ``192.168.1.0/24``).
        
        0.9.9.1 (2012-02-22)
        --------------------
        
        - When used with Pyramid 1.3a9+, views, routes, and other registrations made
          by ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` itself will not show up in the introspectables
          panel.
        
        0.9.9 (2012-02-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Try to take advantage of MakoRendererFactoryHelper in Pyramid 1.3a8+.  If
          we can do this, the toolbar templates won't be effected by normal mako
          settings.  The most visible change is that toolbar mako templates now have
          a ``dbtmako`` extension.
        
        0.9.8 (2012-01-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Show request headers instead of mistakenly showing environ values in
          Headers panel under "Request Headers".  This also fixes a potential
          UnicodeDecodeError.
        
        - Set content_length on response object when we regenerate app_iter while
          replacing original content.
        
        0.9.7 (2011-12-09)
        ------------------
        
        - The performance panel of the debugtoolbar used a variable named
          ``function_calls`` which was not initialised when stats are not
          collected. This caused a ``NameError`` when mako rendered the template with
          the ``strict_undefined`` option.
        
        - Fix Python 3 compatibility in SQLAlchemy panel.
        
        - Make SQLAlchemy explain and select work again.
        
        0.9.6 (2011-12-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Added "Introspection" panel; active only under Pyramid 1.3dev+ (requires
          Pyramid introspection subsystem).
        
        - Address heisenbug reported where performance panel template variables cause
          unexpected results.  Can't repeat, but reporter indicates the fix works for
          him, so hail marying.  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/commit/5719c97ea2a3a41fc01e261403d0167cc38f3b49
        
        0.9.5 (2011-11-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust tox setup to test older Pyramid and WebOb branches under 2.5.
        
        - Convert all templates to Mako.
        
        - Don't rely on ``pyramid.compat.json``.
        
        - Add Tweens toolbar panel.
        
        0.9.4 (2011-09-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgrade to jquery 1.6.4 and tablesorter plugin 2.0.5b
        
        - Introduced new setting ``debugtoolbar.button_style``. Which can be used
          to override the default style (top:30px) set by ``toolbar.css``.
        
        - Compatible with Python 3.2 (requires Pyramid 1.3dev+).
        
        - Appease settings values that were sensitive to ``__getattr__`` in the
          settings debug panel (e.g. MongoDB databases).  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/30
        
        0.9.3 (2011-09-12)
        ------------------
        
        - All debug toolbar panels and underlying views are now always executable by
          entirely anonymous users, regardless of the default permission that may be
          in effect (use the ``NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`` permission for all
          debugtoolbar views).
        
        - Toolbar cookie settings name changed (from fldt to p_dt), to avoid messing
          up folks who use both the flask debugtoolbar and Pyramid's.
        
        - Fix IE7 and IE8 renderings of the toolbar.
        
        0.9.2 (2011-09-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Log an exception body to the debug toolbar logger when an exception
          happens.
        
        - Don't reset the root logger level to NOTSET in the logging panel (changes
          console logging output to sanity again).
        
        0.9.1 (2011-08-30)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` setting is now a tri-state setting.  It
          can be one of ``debug``, ``display`` or ``false``.  ``debug`` means show
          the pretty traceback page with debugging controls.  ``display`` means show
          the pretty traceback package but omit the debugging controls.  ``false``
          means don't show the pretty traceback page.  For backwards compatibility
          purposes, ``true`` means ``debug``.
        
        - A URL is now logged to the console for each exception when
          ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` is ``debug`` or ``display``.  This URL leads
          to a rendering of the "pretty" traceback page for an exception.  This is
          useful when the exception was caused by an AJAX or non-human-driven
          request.  This URL is also injected into the pretty traceback page (at the
          bottom).
        
        - "Unfixed" indentation of SQL EXPLAIN done in 0.9, it broke the explain page
          when a column value isn't a string.
        
        0.9 (2011-08-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed indentation of SQL EXPLAIN by replacing spaces with HTML spaces.
        
        - ``response.charset`` in some undefined user-reported cases may be ``None``,
          which would lead to an exception when attempting to render the debug
          toolbar.  In such cases we now assume the charset is UTF-8.
        
        - Some renderings of the request vars and renderer values would raise an
          uncaught exception.
        
        0.8 (2011-08-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Try to cope with braindead Debian Python installs which package the
          ``pstats`` module separately from Python for god only knows what reason.
          Turn the performance panel off in this case instead of crashing.
        
        0.7 (2011-08-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Docs-only changes.
        
        0.6 (2011-08-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not register an alias when registering an implicit tween factory (compat
          with future 1.2 release).
        
        0.5 (2011-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        - The toolbar didn't work under Windows due to usage of the ``resource``
          module: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/12
        
        0.4 (2011-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Change the default value for ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects`` to
          ``false.`` Rationale: it confuses people when first developing if the
          application they're working on has a home page which does a redirection.
        
        0.3 (2011-08-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Request vars panel would cause a UnicodeDecodeError under some
          circumstances (see https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/9).
        
        - Dynamicize URLs for SQLAlchemy subpanels.
        
        - Require "pyramid>=1.2dev" for install; the trunk is now "1.2dev" instead of
          "1.1.1dev".
        
        - Requires trunk after 2011-08-14: WSGIHTTPException "prepare" method and
          ``alias`` param to add_tween, BeforeRender event has no "_system" attr.
        
        - Fix memory leak.
        
        - HTML HTTP exceptions now are rendered with the debug toolbar div.
        
        - Added NotFound page to demo app and selenium tests.
        
        0.2 (2011-08-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Add SQLAlchemy "explain" and "select" pages (available from the SQLALchemy
          panel next to each query shown in the page).
        
        - Requires newer Pyramid trunk (checked out on 2011-08-07 or later).
        
        - Add a link to the SQLAlchemy demo page from the demo app index page.
        
        0.1 (2011-07-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
