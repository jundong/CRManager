Description: `Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_ bindings for Pyramid
        ============================================================
        
        These are bindings for the `Mako templating system
        <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_ for the `Pyramid
        <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html/>`_ web framework.
        
        
        1.0.2 (2014-04-22)
        ==================
        
        - Fix mako.imports so that aslist() does not flatten. See issue #23
          (https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_mako/issues/23)
          
        1.0.1 (2014-04-16)
        ==================
        
        - Bump the required version of Mako to 0.8 or newer for issue #22 (add
          future_imports). If you would like to use an older version of Mako, please
          pin your dependency to version 0.3.1 of pyramid_mako.
        
        1.0 (2014-04-15)
        ================
        
        - Add new configuration variable for future_imports. See issue #22
          (https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_mako/issues/22)
        - Fix issue #19, whereby pyramid.reload_templates stopped functioning due to
          changes in pyramid_mako. The lookup is now completed at template render,
          instead of when the factory returns the renderer. See:
          (https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_mako/issues/19)
        - Tuple return values in the form of ('defname', {}) are no longer supported,
          and will result in a ValueError being raised.
        - Fix an packaging issue whereby *.foo files were not included in the MANIFEST.
        - Caller-relative template lookup is now supported. Any template that fails
          to be found in the default search paths will be searched relative to the
          caller package.
        - Allow overriding the ``pyramid.reload_templates`` using
          ``mako.reload_templates``.
        - Change the way that custom user values passed to the renderer are merged with
          the system provided variables. This allows the user to pass in a variable
          named 'context' and have it correctly override the system provided context,
          and THEN get correctly renamed so that Mako doesn't complain about a variable
          being passed in that isn't allowed due to it being reserved.
        - Drop testing dependency on ``nose-selecttests``.
        
        0.3.1 (2013-10-22)
        ==================
        
        - Re-enable lazy loading of the mako renderer, allowing the settings
          to be configured after pyramid_mako has been included, as long as everything
          happens in the same commit.
        
        0.3 (2013-10-20)
        ================
        
        - Add a new Configurator directive, ``config.add_mako_renderer`` which
          can be used to add a new mako renderer for a given extension. This
          directive accepts an optional ``settings_prefix`` to load settings and
          configuration differently per-renderer as well.
        
        - Removed the private APIs, ``IMakoLookup``, ``MakoRendererFactoryHelper``,
          and ``renderer_factory``. See the new ``config.add_mako_renderer`` API
          for updating offending code.
        
        - Remove dependency on ``pyramid.interfaces.ITemplateRenderer`` from
          Pyramid 1.5.
        
        0.2 (2013-09-07)
        ================
        
        - Docs up-to-date
        - Latest changes pulled from Pyramid
        - Latest tests pulled from Pyramid
        - All tests updated to refer to fixtures in pyramid_mako
        
        0.1 (2012-03-12)
        ================
        
        - First release. Extracted from Pyramid core.
