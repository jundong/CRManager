Description: ``pyramid_handlers``
        ====================
        
        ``pyramid_handlers`` is a package which allows Pyramid to largely emulate the
        functionality of Pylons 1 "controllers".  Handlers are a synthesis of
        Pyramid *url dispatch* and method introspection of a view class that makes it
        easier to create bundles of view logic which reacts to particular route
        patterns.  It works under Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.
        
        See `http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_handlers/en/latest/
        <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_handlers/en/latest/>`_ for
        detailed documentation.
        
        
        
        0.5 (2012-03-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Python 3.2 compatibility (sans ZCML support; ``pyramid_zcml`` does not work
          under Python 3).
        
        - Removed Python 2.5 compatibility.  This also means Jython compatibility has
          been dropped.  If you need Python 2.5 compatibility, use 0.4.
        
        - No longer raises a ConfigurationError when an ``__action_decorator__`` is
          an instance method (there's no distinction between unbound methods and
          functions under Python 3).
        
        0.4 (2011-11-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Add ``pyramid.handlers.method_name_xformer`` setting, which allows the view
          associated with a handler action to match when a converted action name is
          found in the URL (as opposed to the original method name).  See this
          version's docs for more info.
        
        - Use submodule for docs theme.
        
        - Modify tox testing scheme.
        
        0.3 (2011-08-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Using ``None`` as a pattern is no longer permitted in a call to
          ``add_handler``.  This is for compatibility with an upcoming Pyramid "route
          groups" feature.
        
        0.2 (2011-07-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix include example in docs.
        
        - Add example of ``__action_decorator__`` in documentation.
        
        - Drop install dependency on pyramid_zcml.
        
        - Add a tox.ini for Jenkins testing.
        
        - Fix tests for Pyramid 1.1.
        
        0.1 (2011-01-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release, broken out of Pyramid core.
